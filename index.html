                Hello, my name is Rojin Pourkhomami and I am currently studying Full-Stack Web Development at the University of North Carolina, Charlotte.
		
			<p>
                I was born in Tehran, Iran and moved to the States at the age of five. My native language is Farsi and secondary is English. I can also speak French on a conversational level as I am still continuing to learn. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Growing up, I found great interest in the arts (movies, music, painting, photography, etc). Being able to create and design has always been a drive of mine, therefore why I decided to enroll in the coding programing.			</p>
